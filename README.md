# Secrets
I learned to build this website in [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course.

This website enables people to share their secrets anonymously among the registered members. <br />
Implemented authentication using encryption and then leveled it up using hashing and multiple saltingrounds via bcrypt package.   <br />
Used passport.js to add cookies and sessions. Implemented third partyauthentication (Google OAuth 2.0) to make the website more trustworthy and ease up sign in/up.<br />

Currently facing some issues while deploying, but this is how it looks like when run on local server.<br />
